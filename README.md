# CSE 231 Compiler - Chocopy

## Project Milestone 2

- Which features had interactions that you didn’t expect before you started implementing?
  
  String and list @DSC

- What feature are you most proud of in your implementation and why?
  
  nested function @KSB

- What features remain to implement?
  
  basically everything is covered. More test @DSC

- Is there anything you’re stuck on?
  
  string in class global @XHF

- Consider programs that work in Python, but not in ChocoPy, involving strings or lists. Pick one that you think would be a straightforward extension to your compiler – describe how you would implement it. Pick one that you think would be an extremely difficult extension to your compiler – describe why.
  
  - straightforward: [comprehension]@DSC
  
  - hard: garbage collection
